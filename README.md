# Employee-Directory
An employee directory created using React
# Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory

## Overview

For this assignment, you'll create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story

* AS A user
* I WANT to be able to view my entire employee directory at once
* SO THAT I have quick access to their information, including name, title, department, and email, both online and in situations where I am unable to connect to the internet.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
